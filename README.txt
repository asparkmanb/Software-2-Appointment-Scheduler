How to navigate program 
------------------------
Run program
Login using valid credentials
This will take you to the appointments/main page. This page allows you to select/add/update/delete appointments. There are buttons to change to customers and reports page.
To add/update/delete customers - Select “View Customers” from main page. This will bring you to the customers page where you can view/edit/add/delete customers.
To view reports, select “View Reports” from the main screen. Select which report to run.
To exit program, select “Exit”

The third report that I decided to run in A3f is the report of how many appointments each user was assigned. For example, if there were 5 appointments that had a user id of 2, then the report would show User ID 2 has 5 appointments.
